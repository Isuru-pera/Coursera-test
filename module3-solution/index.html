        <body>Apparel industry is one of the biggest industry in Sri Lanka. When it comes to advancing country’s economy, apparel industries play a major role. About half of the county’s total exports are from apparel sector. Also about 15 percent of the country’s workforce is enrolled in apparel sector. Sri Lanka is one of the top apparel producing countries in the world. 
        In apparel industry they get paid for time to make a garment. Because of that measuring time is one of the critical factor in apparel industry. To make all kind of important decisions, management use time information as their reference. In order to compete in the market, the management should have a clear understanding about how much time does it takes to finish an order before acquiring it, how much time does it takes to reach the ordered materials to the factory, how many workers do the need to finish a specific order and so many other things. In such cases measuring time for specific tasks are very important. In that way management can get a clear understanding about previously explained matters.
        When it comes to measuring time it is hard in manual operations rather than that of automated operations. Because routines of human labors are varying considerably with time. In a country like Sri Lanka with less technological exposure and lower labor cost, many manufacturing companies relaying manual operations. Also, since it is hard to automate the sewing operation, still manual workers are used for sewing operation and usually 60 percent of total workforce in an apparel company is for sewing operation. Even the organizations with lean background find it difficult to reduce time wastage, since it is difficult to identify. In order to identify time waste, every activity has to be observed sharply and it is turn out to be a costly and time consuming procedure. 
        So far what most of the apparel industries in Sri Lanka does is that, they assign a skilled team to evaluate time for operation wise and labor wise. That team measure time manually for samples and make reports for future decisions. This process will take much time and effort also since they measure samples it is not the correct results. Sometimes correct results can be varying from sample data. Because of that decisions based on those data can be faulty. 
        Imagine a system that can track time for every kind of style wise and labor wise time data real time and store those data in a data base without any human interaction for future decisions. In that way company can save a lot of money by removing the team that assign to measure the time. Also since this system give the real time data for all stations and all style wise information (not the sample data) more accurate decisions can be made. Using that time information to evaluate workers, skill matrix can be to used measure for different styles how the worker’s performance. Also, that information can be used to evaluate production line efficiency too. 
        In this project main aim is to design and development of a system to monitor information about ongoing sewing operation of each workstation in a production line of an apparel plant. In order to achieve that aim there are three main objectives. Those are as follows,
        Design and development of reliable data acquisition system to collect real time data from a sewing module.
        Design and development of data transferring system to transfer data to a computer and a database.
        Design and development of a system and interface for online data analysis and graphical interpretation.Apparel industry is one of the biggest industry in Sri Lanka.
